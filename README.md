# Huffman-coding
![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-C-blue.svg)
This project involves implementing the Huffman coding algorithm in C programming language to compress various file types, such as images, text, and videos. The goal is to provide an efficient tool for reducing file sizes without sacrificing quality, with the aim of saving storage space. This implementation utilizes the Huffman algorithm, a widely used compression technique, and is designed to be user-friendly and effective.
